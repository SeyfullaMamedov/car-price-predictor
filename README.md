## Overview
The Car Price Prediction (CPP) project is a machine learning applicaiton
designed to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as
car brand, model, year, color, kilometers driven, and engine size.
The project leverages a RandomForestRegressor model to make predictions and provides
a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.

## Features
### Home Page
Welcome page displaying the CPP logo and brief information.
### Prediction Page
Allows users to input car details and predict the using a 
trained RandomForestRegressor model.
### About Us Page
Provides information about the author behind the project.

## Installation
#### Python 3.7 or higher.
#### pip (Python Package installer)

## Data
`car_prediction6.csv`: Contains normalized data used for training model. <br>
`final_data7`: Contains original data with raw values.

## Usage
`Home Page`: Displays the project logo and welcome message. <br>
`Prediction Page`: Users can input car details such as brand, model, year, color, kilometers driven and engine size.
Upon clicking the 'Predict' button, the model predicts the car price and displays
the result along with relevant images and videos of the car.
`About Us Page`: Provides information about the development.

## Customization
The project includes custom CSS to enhance the apperance of the Streamlit app. You can modify the 
`CUSTOM_CSS` variable in `main.py` to change the styles.

## Acknowledgements
